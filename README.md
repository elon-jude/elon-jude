# Elon-Jude's Web Development Project

👋 Hi, I’m **Elon-Jude**! I'm currently working on a beginner-friendly web development project where I’m building a user input form using **HTML**. The goal is to practice form design, input validation, and eventually connect it to backend services or email.

## 👀 What I'm Working On:

- A full **HTML form** that includes:
  - Text, email, and password fields
  - Radio buttons, dropdowns, and a textarea
- Exploring ways to handle form submissions (e.g., FormSubmit, Formspree, or PHP).
- Open to adding basic **CSS styling** or simple **JavaScript validation**.

## 🌱 Learning Goals:
- **HTML** (form creation, structure, and layout)
- **CSS** (styling forms for a better user experience)
- **JavaScript** (basic validation techniques)
- **Backend services** for handling form submissions (e.g., PHP or connecting to an email service)

## 💞️ Looking for:
- Beginners who want to learn together and improve their web development skills
- Anyone who can help with:
  - Form validation (client-side and server-side)
  - Backend/email integration (using services like Formspree, or PHP)
  - UI/UX improvements to enhance form accessibility and design
  - Hosting on platforms like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or others
